            The greatest achievements was at first and <br />
            for a time a dream. The oak sleeps in the <br />
            acron, the bird waits in the egg, and in the <br/>
            highest vision of the sould a waking angel <br />
            stirs. Dreams are the seedings of realities. <br />
